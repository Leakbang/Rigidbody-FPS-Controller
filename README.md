 
# Rigidbody FPS Controller
A rigidbody player controller.

This is part of [Robust FPS Framework](https://github.com/Leakbang/Robust-FPS-Framework/tree/physics-movement). At the moment Robust FPS Framework uses Q_Move. This is an attempt to replace Q_Move with a more robust and easier to maintain component.
